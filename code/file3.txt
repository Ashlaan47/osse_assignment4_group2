Content Writing Example #1: Blog Posts
There’s a reason that blogging is the most common type of content writing, and that is because blogs have a wide range of business benefits. From helping with SEO and getting your website to the top of the rankings to elevating your business as an expert in your field, blogs are still an important type of content to focus on. Not sure what to write about? Turn to your team for help—brainstorming topics for content writing with your team will help you discover blog topics you may not have thought about. No matter how you come up with your blog post ideas, the important thing is to have a blog and use it.

Content Writing Example #2: Social media posts
Creating social media posts is a great way to hone your content writing skills. Since posts are typically very short, snappy, and quick, you can easily try out different styles of writing and see what people respond to. It’s easy to change direction and adapt if you need to tweak your writing style since social media posts are typically fluid and changeable by nature. You can also practice A/B testing with your social media ads—try writing two different posts and sending it to similar demographics and see which one performs better.
