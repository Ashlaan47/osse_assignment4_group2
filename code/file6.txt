Content Writing Example #10: Video content
It may seem strange to think about videos as a place where you need content writing, but the truth is that your videos will be much more successful if you script them before filming. Writing out the conversation points or scripting the entire video is a great way to make sure the videos stay on topic and cover what they need to cover. Think about your goals when creating video content and consider writing out outlines or full scripts if necessary. Sometimes people can be nervous about being on camera, and having a script or loose talking points can help take the anxiety out of what to say.
